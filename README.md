Angular Regular Expression Search
====================

This is an application that I chose to build in the process of learning AngularJS and SOAP based web services.

Included in the package is a PHP based SOAP proxy that accepts a query from Javascript, pulls the WSDL from http://regexlib.com and uses the appropriate service, then converts the response to JSON and returns that to the front end.
